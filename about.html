        I want to tell you a little about my family. My family is quite large. My family consists of my dad, mum, one sister, one brother and myself. Dad and mom are the individuals I love and respect the most in my life. My mum is a teacher and my dad is a Polis Bantuan at UiTM Machang. My mother is 45 years old and my father is 50 years old. They have been dedicated their lives in raising the 3 of us and ensure that we become successful individuals in this world and hereafter. I thank God to have such great parents. My sister is 19 years old and my brother is 16 years old and both of them are still studying. I am very thankful to God because my life is complete with the presence of them all.

        During my free time, I always play online games. Among the online games I like are 'Mobile Legends', 'Fifa' and 'Valorant'. I usually play online games with my friends. By playing online games, I can add friends from all over the world because online games cover the whole world. Online games have been my hobby since I was little. However, I never neglected my learning sessions. I will divide the time to study and also the time to play. If there is an assignment that I need to complete, I make sure to complete it first before playing online games.
