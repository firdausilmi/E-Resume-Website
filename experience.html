    <h2>WORKING EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <p>
      I used to work as a runner during the semester break. My intention in working is to earn more money and avoid boredom during the semester break. Alhamdulillah, I managed to become a runner with the help of my friend because she told me about this job opportunity. Working as a runner is not too easy and not too difficult. This is because I only need to deliver the goods and collect payment from the buyer. I just need to make sure that the item arrives safely and on time. Among the challenges of being a runner are traffic congestion while delivering goods, hot weather and heavy rain as well as the difficulty of finding the location of the buyer’s home. However, it gave me experience and also a lesson to me in finding Halal sustenance.
